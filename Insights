Here are my top insights & recommendations for Maven Amazonas.

1) Most customers pay using 1 to 3 payments per order.
2) Average cost of products is $120.65
3) Most of Maven Amazonasâ€™ customers use credit card for their purchases. So, money back with credit card could be a way to ensure customer retention.
4) 7% orders are late. Identify & Incentivise delivery teams to encourage better performance.
5) Running a discount on products from the garden tools category could lead to increase in sales & revenue. May be combo offers with products from housewares category is a direction to consider.
6) Prepare ahead for on-time deliveries especially for Q3 of 2018 to meet the increasing order volume load.
